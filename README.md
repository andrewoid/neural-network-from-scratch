This code is part of a 3 hour class on Artificial Intelligence and Neural Networks.

This code has been adapted from Finn Eggers multi-part series, "Neural Network Tutorial Fully Connected"

The original code wasn't object oriented and was difficult to read. This is more suited for students and teaching concepts.

Building
=
To build the library into the "library/build/libs" directory
> gradlew library:jar

TODO
=
- Move DisplayNeuralNetwork and NeuralNetworkComponent to the example module (small)
- Remove pom.xml (small)
- Fix false positives generated by CalculatorNetworkTraining (more layers?, more neurons?, more training?)
- CalculatorNetworkTraining should load/save a network from JSON.
- DigitInteraction should load a network from JSON instead of training a network.
- IdxReader should provide a way to load the images into memory, so it can be used to train a network later.
- Write a unit test for Network.saveToJson() and NetworkFactory.loadFromJson().
- DisplayNeuralNetwork should load a network from a file. (small)
- DisplayNeuralNetwork should display different colors for Neuron.value and Weights. Colors are ints from 0 to 16777215. Neuron.value and weight are numbers from 0-1 (think). You can use that to map it to an int in that range and create a Color using the constructor Color(int)
